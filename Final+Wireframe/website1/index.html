    <p><h3>About Me</h3>
        <h5>Hello, my name is Sarah Burnett. Thank you for checking out my art portfolio website.
        <br>
        I'm front the western suburbs of Chicago, and have most of my drawing dedicated to things non-realism orientened. I draw animals (mainly horses) as well as mystical creatures, original characters, and anything that can be taken from my mind instead of the things I see. I am, however, beginning to get into 'picture drawing' where I take a photograph and digitally draw over it to make it look unique and artistic.
        <br>
        Below are just a few of my many drawings, phtos, and creations that you can browse over. It is difficult to come up with new ideas all the time, however, if you are interested in a more personal drawing, I'd be more than willing to work with an idea you have and make it a commission! 
        <br>
        Thank you!</h5>
